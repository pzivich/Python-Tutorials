    "To begin, we will start with `for` loops. `for` loops are useful for going through a known group of objects or up to a specific number of times. As a motivating example, let's say we want to write code that counts up to five. While we could write out 5 `print()` commands, it is easier to use a loop. Below is an example"

Being able to read errors and debug code is a useful skill and can save you many hours of staring at code and wondering why it doesn't work (I know from personal experience). The errors tell the line causing problems, some basic error information, and if the code uses other files it traces back the error (we won't encounter this till later).\n",
